# SQL
End-to-end data processing with PosgreSQL and Python parser

This project parses through the complete dblp dataset, and imports the data into PostgreSQL database.
Parser was written in Python and uses xml.sax for parsing the xml file.
Once data is imported into the database, it is updated and analyzed using SQL queries.
This project was one of the many assignments I worked on while taking Data Intensive Computing Systems class.
